## Flawed Fabrication Ideas
### Skewmorphic Smartlight Control
Controlling smartbulbs by using gesture controls on a kind of phantom lightswitch cord. Perhaps with OpenPose.

Denver: "Yeah the Lifx bulbs really need some kind of switch or something, you just don't always have your phone on you"
Lachlan: "It should use open pose or something, you when you do a gesture like pulling a hanging light switch cord"

## Bin Juice
### Lazer Type-writer
(summary needed)

### Pick-and-Place Pizza Machine
Uses pick-and-place machine to apply toppings to pizza.

### Pick-and-Place Printing Press

### Robotic Zen Garden
Chris: "We should have, like, sensors to detect the social tension in the Hackerspace... and like."

...

Chris: "If it exceeds a certain level, a little robot arms starts raking some sand. Like a zen garden."

### Ethically Source Cocaine (Adric, Mitch, Tom & Denver)
We should have ethically sourced cocaine, where each batch has a blockchain tracking code, with the purity content and a picture of the maker smiling.
The only issue would be there poor columbian farmers keep wondering why their whole operation keeps getting shut down.

### Saw-blade Wielding Robot Arm
(summary needed)

Andrew: * _cutting something with circular saw_ *

Denver: "***we should make a circular saw with a stepper motor***... so then we make make it play music with Sam's stepper music script."

Andrew: "And then we can put it on your robot arms!"

## Honourable Mentions

No like, you're undercover _AS_ a police officer.

_Origin:_ Chris misheard Denver saying "Hello fellow kids" as "Hello fellow pigs".

### Speedometer Using Demerit Points as Units
Ask Kerri

### Electronic Swear Jar
Detects swearing and subtracts money from an account.
